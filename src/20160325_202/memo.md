# A

* Can we return the change

# B

* v liters of paint (v <= 10^6)
* digit d requires a[d] liters to paint
* Find maximum number that we can write (> 0)
  * if we cannot write anything, then return -1

# C

* during each round, a supervisor and n-1 persons (n < 10^5)
* a[i] := the i-th person wants to play a[i] rounds (a[i] < 10^9)
* What is the minimum number of rounds of the game as players

## Example 1

```
n=3
A = {3, 2, 2}

*not the minimum number
1: {3, 1, 1}
2: {3, 0, 0}
3: {2, 0, -1}
4: {1, 0, -2}
5: {0, 0, -3}

1: {2, 1, 2}
2: {1, 0, 2}
3: {0, 0, 1}
4: {-1, 0, 0}
